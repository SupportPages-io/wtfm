For requested hosted generation or analysis, follow the returned setup step in order: browser sign-in/account creation, help-centre selection, device permissions, then browser repository connection. The action tools open required setup pages; show the returned URL only if browser_opened is false. Continue with supportpages_setup_hosted and its next_arguments after each step, then retry resume_tool with resume_arguments. Never substitute the app homepage or skip sign-in to invite repository connection. User browser consent remains required. ' +
    'For questions about existing hosted videos or video walkthroughs, call supportpages_list_walkthroughs, then supportpages_get_walkthrough for details. Article lists and local files are not the hosted video inventory. If the tools report server_update_required, explain that the hosted API needs deployment and stop this read request; do not substitute a filesystem search or infer that there are no videos. ' + showArticleLinkInstruction + ' ' + writerLaunchInstruction + ' ' + codexWriterLaunchInstruction + ' ' + backgroundParentInstruction + ' For article creation requests, check supportpages_status and finish supportpages_init when needed, preserving the original request. Always call supportpages_create_article to choose the permitted execution location before writing any article content or images, even if a generation skill was selected directly or is cached in this session. A hosted operation runs entirely in SupportPages: show the returned review link, which fills in as the article is written, then finish the turn. Do not poll it with supportpages_get_operation — use that only when the user asks how a run is going, or to recover after a client restart — and never launch a local writer. A local result uses the prepared task described below. Generation skills are private writer implementation files, not the main-agent entry point. Hand the prepared task brief to the writer, which must pass its entrypoint check first. It checks account-wide hosting capacity first. If preparation returns plan_limit, do not launch a writer: show the usage, upgrade link and manage-articles link, then wait for the user to free capacity or upgrade before retrying preparation. Prepare the article without preference overrides unless the user explicitly requests a different behavior; saved personal preferences apply. Preparation creates the preview when supported. Show its editor_url before launching any writer. Preparation does not start writing: follow the returned prefer_background setting to launch the task_brief in the foreground or using the current coding client background facility, then report started with supportpages_update_run. Use the existing directory in task_brief.workspace without worktree isolation or a new checkout. If background execution is unavailable or requires a worktree, explain and use foreground for the same prepared run. After update_run, show its preview link again, including when it came from an earlier run. If a tool reports an error, show any editor_url in error.details alongside the error and recovery instructions. The writer entrypoint records actual startup locally and activates the prepared relay even if the host misses update_run. Host updates still record execution mode and task identity. The relay uploads live previews and opens the browser once when readable text arrives if enabled. Do not open it a second time. For retry requests call retry_article after stopping the old writer. The writer only generates and validates local artifacts; the main agent handles MCP calls after the host completion notification. On success call supportpages_complete_article automatically, show its draft editor link, open it only if the returned open_when_ready is true, and ask whether the user wants this draft published. If completion reports upload_failed, generation is finished but delivery to the editor is unconfirmed: show the specific cause, editor link and next action, do not call update_run with failed, and do not infer that no remote draft exists. No answer means leave a draft. Never publish without an affirmative response for that draft, automate browser publication, or overwrite browser edits after a revision conflict. Stop host tasks before releasing runs. Do not claim progress is live after a client restart. Do not launch a separate agent CLI or ask for model/API credentials. If status or init reports local, this folder has no help centre: articles are saved as Markdown and screenshots, and the saved markdown path returned by complete_article is the deliverable. Show that path instead of an editor link and never ask whether to publish automatically. Only when the user explicitly asks to host or publish saved local articles, call supportpages_publish and follow its sign-in, help-centre and article-selection steps. Otherwise do not start browser sign-in or upload. A completion may return show_to_user: show that text verbatim as its own paragraph, after the saved path or draft review link, and nothing more; when absent, add no hosting or repository copy. If the user asks to stop hosting reminders, call supportpages_set_hosting_reminders with enabled=false. When a result includes telemetry_notice, show it once, verbatim. If the user asks to stop or allow anonymous usage reporting, call supportpages_set_telemetry.' });
